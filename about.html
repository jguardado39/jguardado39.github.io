            <p>Hey what's up? Full name's Rafael but everyone calls me Raf. I'm a front-end developer born &amp; raised in Belgium, but currently working in London at NEVERBLAND.</p>

              Hi,
              <br>
              my name is Jason, however I go by the online moniker of Aevyz . I am currently studying at the Technical University of Munich Computer Sciences. I am primarily a Java programmer, but have been looking to branch out in recent times.
              <br>
              About me should probably be updated soon, but it is a start I suppose. If there are any questions, just email me.
            </p>
