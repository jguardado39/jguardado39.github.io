## Angular 2 QuickStart Source

This repository holds the TypeScript source code of the [angular.io quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html),
the foundation for most of the documentation samples and potentially a good starting point for your application.

It's been extended with testing support so you can start writing tests immediately.

**This is not the perfect arrangement for your application. It is not designed for production.
It exists primarily to get you started quickly with learning and prototyping in Angular 2**

We are unlikely to accept suggestions about how to grow this QuickStart into something it is not.
Please keep that in mind before posting issues and PRs.
